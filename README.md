# qbasic-biosphere
BioSphere is a Qbasic cellular automaton simulation that I wrote when I was 15 and submitted to the "All Basic Code" newsletter. 

Special thanks to QbasicNews.com who [archived](http://www.qbasicnews.com/abc/showsnippet.php?filename=AI.ABC&snippet=7) this code and decompressed the ABC file format.
